        <h4>UX Design Case Study - What’s For Dinner? Mobile App</h4>
        <p><b>Problem:</b> In a busy household, meal planning and execution are a lot of work, and 
            too often seem to fall primarily on one person. As of yet, there isn’t a web-based 
            meal planning platform that allows members of the same household to identify the 
            tasks involved in meal planning, let alone to select which household member will 
            take responsibility for each task.<br></br> 
            <b>Solution:</b> A mobile app for households to make meal planning easier and to 
            enable all household members to share in the process.
